Brain Tumor Detection using CNN model:
1. Download the dataset from Kaggle.com. Upload your file to dropbox.com and unzip it.
2. "No" represents healthy images, "Yes" represents unhealthy images.
3. Data is split as such: 70% for training data, 15% for validation data and 15% for test data.
4. Build the model using CNN , adding Convo2D, MaxPooling2D and Batch Normalisation.![Screenshot (29)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28fdb565-727a-45ce-ae2f-cea560b2f759)
5. Train the model ![Screenshot (93)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/379f2270-6ffd-493a-a78d-cdfeebd79a3f)
    predicting the accuracy and loss of model.
6. Graph Representation of the model :

Predicting the loss and accuracy through graph.
7. The accuaracy of the model is 33.33333432674408 %
8. The model takes the MRI image as input and predicts the healthy(No) and unheathy image(Yes) respectively.
